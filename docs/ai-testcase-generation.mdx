# AI-Powered Test Case Generation

## Overview

Exgenix offers comprehensive AI-driven test case generation for FIX protocol APIs, custom binary APIs (OUCH, Enhanced Trading Interface, etc.), and business requirement documents, enabling complete test coverage with minimal manual efforts.

---

## Part 1: Generating Test Cases from FIX Specification

### Step 1: Access Auto Generate Test Cases

- Navigate to the sidebar in Exenix
- Click on "Auto Generate Test Cases" option

![Sidebar - Auto Generate Test Cases](../static/img/aigeneration.png)

---

### Step 2: Upload FIX Specification Document

- Select "Document Upload" option
- Upload your FIX specification document (supports various formats)
- _[Add screenshot of document upload interface]_

---

### Step 3: Define Additional Requirements (AI Prompt)

The Additional Requirements section functions as an AI prompt where you can specify:
- Target API for test case generation
- Desired test data format
- Example prompt: *"Write test cases in FIX field=value format for New Order Single API"*
- _[Add screenshot of Additional Requirements section with example prompt]_

**Supported Output Formats:**
- FIX tag=value format
- Proprietary binary formats (OUCH, Enhanced Trading Interface, etc.)

---

### Step 4: Set Category and Generate

- Set the category to "FIX API BRD" to link requirements with the uploaded FIX specification
- Click "Generate Test Cases" button
- The AI engine analyzes your requirements and the FIX specification (this may take a few minutes)
- _[Add screenshot of category selection and Generate button]_

---

### Step 5: Review Generated Test Cases

Once generation is complete, test cases are automatically organized into three categories:

**Positive Test Cases**
- Valid flows with complete required test data
- All necessary fields and values to simulate successful scenarios
- _[Add screenshot of positive test cases section]_

**Negative Test Cases**
- Scenarios for missing tags
- Invalid tag values
- Permission violations
- Constraint violations
- _[Add screenshot of negative test cases section]_

**Edge Cases**
- Boundary value testing
- Unusual sequencing scenarios
- Other nuanced conditions
- Details include which fields and values should be changed
- _[Add screenshot of edge cases section]_

---

### Step 6: Export to Excel

- Click "Export" to download the full test suite as an Excel file
- Convert exported data into data sheets format
- _[Add screenshot of export option and Excel output]_

---

### Step 7: Import into API Configuration

- Import the data sheets directly into your existing API configuration
- The API configuration is also auto-generated from the same API document
- _[Add screenshot of import process]_

---

## Part 2: Test Configuration and Execution

### Step 8: Design Test Configuration

- Navigate to "Test Configuration" module
- Design your APIs and their execution sequence
- Example: Configure New Order Single API to run in three loops:
  - Loop 1: Positive cases
  - Loop 2: Negative cases
  - Loop 3: Edge cases
- Each API can be tested in isolation for all possible permutations and combinations
- _[Add screenshot of test configuration with loop setup]_

---

### Step 9: Execute Test Suite

- Navigate to the "Execution" module
- Click "Run" to execute the configured test suite
- Upon completion, you're automatically redirected to the Reports section
- _[Add screenshot of execution module]_

---

### Step 10: Review Test Reports

The Reports module displays results mirroring your scenario sequence:

**Report Features:**
- Captured FIX messages for each iteration
- Actual vs. Expected field values comparison
- Pass/Fail status for each test
- Step-level details from specification
- Human-readable format for easy analysis
- Supports review of hundreds of data combinations simultaneously
- _[Add screenshot of reports with pass/fail details]_
- _[Add screenshot showing FIX message details]_

---

## Part 3: Generating Test Cases from Business Documents

### Step 11: Upload Business Requirement Documents

Xenix extends AI capabilities beyond API specifications to business documents:
- Upload Business Requirement Documents (BRD)
- Upload Impact Assessment Reports
- Upload any requirement document including images or workflows
- _[Add screenshot of business document upload interface]_

---

### Step 12: Provide Intelligent Prompts

- Enter domain-specific prompts based on your requirements
- Example: *"Generate test cases for unpaid identifier based on the provided document"*
- The AI uses both document content and its domain expertise
- _[Add screenshot of prompt section with example]_

---

### Step 13: AI Analysis and Test Case Generation

The AI engine:
- Analyzes document content instantly
- Extracts testable requirements
- Maps requirements to test scenarios:
  - Positive scenarios
  - Negative scenarios
  - Boundary condition scenarios
- Generates complete structured test cases within seconds
- _[Add screenshot of AI processing/analysis]_

---

### Step 14: Review Generated Test Cases from BRD

Each generated test case includes:
- Detailed test inputs
- Expected outcomes
- Test data specifications
- Ensures comprehensive coverage with no missed scenarios
- _[Add screenshot of BRD-generated test cases]_

---

## Quality Validation and Accuracy

### Step 15: Validate Test Case Accuracy

Xenix ensures test case quality through:

**Permutation and Combination Analysis**
- Mathematical algorithm-based generation
- Line-by-line breakdown of requirements
- Mapping requirements to specific test cases

**Domain Expert Validation**
- Compare AI-generated test cases with manually created expert test cases
- Verify test case descriptions match expert standards
- Verify test steps align with domain expertise
- _[Add screenshot showing comparison between AI and expert test cases]_
- _[Add screenshot with highlighted matching test case]_

---

## Key Benefits

- **Complete Coverage:** From low-level binary APIs to high-level business documents
- **Automated Accuracy:** Mathematically validated permutation-based test generation
- **Speed:** Hundreds of test scenarios generated in minutes
- **Domain Intelligence:** AI models tuned for trading and financial domains
- **Focus on Quality:** Automation handles complexity, allowing teams to focus on quality assurance
