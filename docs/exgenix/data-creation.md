Exgenix’s API automation capabilities also act as a **Test Data Factory**:

- Generate **on-demand synthetic datasets** for Risk and Clearing modules  
- Maintain **data lineage** from trade inception to clearing confirmation  
- Replay **real-world order traffic** to simulate end-to-end trade lifecycle  

<Zap size={24} color="#facc15" /> **Outcome:**  Instant, production-like datasets — ensuring faster validation cycles for dependent systems.
