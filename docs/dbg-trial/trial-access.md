### Unified QA Governance View — Prototype Edition


This platform is a prototype environment designed to demonstrate how Exgenix will unify QA governance across every critical subsystem of a stock exchange — from API-level validation to post-trade surveillance.  

The goal of this sandbox is to showcase the intended workflow, visibility, and traceability model, not to represent final production behavior, feature completeness, or performance.

- <Check size={20} color="#4caf50" /> **Experience AI-generated test cases** directly from Jira stories using stock-exchange-tuned QA models
