# True No-Code Automation for Complex Trading Protocols

---

**“Empower QA teams to automate without coding.”**

The trial includes a simplified no-code automation setup for **T7 ETI v14 APIs**, covering:

- `Session Logon / Logout`  
- `User Logon / Logout ` 
- `New Order Single ` 
- `Replace Order`  
- `Cancel Order ` 
- `Trade Execution ` 

Users can:

- Through the Exgenix UI, DBG team members can: Configure and sequence API executions (e.g., New → Replace → Cancel → Trade). 
- Execute positive, negative, and boundary condition test cases.
- Monitor API responses and message validation through the integrated simulator.
- The Exchange Simulator (built within the trial) is designed to replicate core message flows and validations — including order acceptance, rejections, and trade acknowledgements — while maintaining realistic response patterns.

:::note
This simulator is a lightweight version designed to help QA teams explore key features.  
For full functionality, integrate Exgenix with an actual exchange environment or the official **T7 Simulator** provided by **Deutsche Börse**.
