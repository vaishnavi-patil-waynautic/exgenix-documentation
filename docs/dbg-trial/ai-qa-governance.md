# AI-Powered Test Case Generation & Governance

---

**“AI that thinks like a QA lead — not a script.”**

The trial also includes access to the **AI QA Governance workspace**, where DBG users can explore:
 - **Automated test case generation** from uploaded API specs, BRDs, or JIRA-linked stories.

 - **Smart traceability mapping** — linking requirements, test cases, and execution results in one view.

 - **Integration with JIRA/ADO** for continuous synchronization and visibility.


This capability demonstrates how AI can go beyond test generation to provide **governance intelligence**, ensuring test coverage remains accurate, current, and audit-ready as exchange systems evolve.
