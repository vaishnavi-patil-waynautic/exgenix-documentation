# AI-Powered Test Case Generation & Governance

---

**“AI that thinks like a QA lead — not a script.”**

The trial also includes access to the **AI QA Governance workspace**, where DBG users can explore:

- <span style={{display:'inline-flex', alignItems:'center', gap:'8px'}}>
    <Sparkles size={20} color="#F59E0B" />
    <strong>Automated test case generation</strong> from uploaded API specs, BRDs, or JIRA-linked stories.
  </span>

- <span style={{display:'inline-flex', alignItems:'center', gap:'8px'}}>
    <GitBranch size={20} color="#10B981" />
    <strong>Smart traceability mapping</strong> — linking requirements, test cases, and execution results in one view.
  </span>

- <span style={{display:'inline-flex', alignItems:'center', gap:'8px'}}>
    <RefreshCcwDot size={20} color="#3B82F6" />
    <strong>Integration with JIRA/ADO</strong> for continuous synchronization and visibility.
  </span>



This capability demonstrates how AI can go beyond test generation to provide **governance intelligence**, ensuring test coverage remains accurate, current, and audit-ready as exchange systems evolve.
