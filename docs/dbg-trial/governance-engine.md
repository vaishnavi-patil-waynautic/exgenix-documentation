# QA Governance Engine for Stock Exchanges

---

**“From APIs to Clearing — One Governance View.”**

Exgenix unifies QA governance across all critical layers of exchange systems:

- Gateway
- Matching Engine
- Risk
- Clearing
- Surveillance

Within this environment, users can:

- View requirements and associated test cases in a single workspace.
- Understand 1:1 and 1-to-many traceability.
- Experience a consolidated QA view for regulatory and functional compliance.

This structured governance approach transforms traditional QA execution into auditable quality oversight, ensuring every exchange module is validated against business and regulatory expectations.
