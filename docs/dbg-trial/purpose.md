# Purpose of the Trial

The objective of this trial is to help the DBG QA team experience:

- End-to-end QA governance visibility — from requirement to execution to reporting.
- Hands-on exploration of Exgenix’s no-code automation for ETI APIs.
- AI-generated test case creation and mapping for traceability.
- Simulator-based execution of standard order lifecycle scenarios.

The trial setup has been pre-configured to offer a balanced combination of functionality, usability, and governance insight, allowing your team to evaluate key product capabilities within a controlled and secure environment.
