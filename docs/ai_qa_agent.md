## Overview
Waynautic's AI QA Agent integrates with Exgenix to transform QA governance for stock exchanges, providing intelligent test case generation, comprehensive traceability, and real-time insights across the entire testing lifecycle.

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Seamless JIRA Integration
- Automatic sync of requirements from JIRA to AI QA Agent.
- Eliminates manual data entry and reduces risk of copy-paste errors.
- Requirements appear instantly in the interface.
- Reduces requirement onboarding time from hours to seconds.

### 2. AI-Powered Test Case Generation
- Domain-trained AI models specialized for exchange & trading environments.
- Generate test cases for one or multiple requirements at once.
- Produces Positive, Negative, and Boundary test scenarios in seconds.
- Reduces test case design effort by 80%.

### 3. Detailed Test Case Structure
Each generated test case includes:
- Description & objective
- Step-by-step test instructions
- Test data aligned to exchange-specific logic
- Validation criteria

### 4. Review and Approval Workflow
- Accept or reject test cases individually or in bulk.
- Feedback continuously improves AI model quality.
- Balances automation with domain expert oversight.

### 5. Full Editability
- Modify any part of generated test cases.
- Add/remove steps, modify data, refine workflows.
- Ensures alignment with organizational standards.

### 6. Hierarchical Organization
Structured folder-based grouping across exchange modules such as:
- Gateway
- Matching Engine
- Risk Management
- Clearing/Settlement
- Surveillance

### 7. End-to-End Traceability
- Requirements ↔ Test Cases ↔ Executions ↔ Defects mapping.
- Automatic updates when requirements change.
- Prevents coverage gaps.

### 8. Defect Traceability and Impact Analysis
- Map defects to test cases and back to originating requirements.
- Historical defect import and trend analytics.
- Enables data-driven release decisions.

### 9. Conversational AI Interface
Natural language questions produce real-time QA insights:
- Coverage status
- Risk areas
- Release readiness
- Developer impact assessment
